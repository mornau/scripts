Scripts
=======

These are various (mostly bash) scripts others might find useful, or might find destroyed all their data.

**remove_kernel_images**

Did /boot run full again? Meh. Run this to remove all kernel images not currently in use. Including *newer* ones.

**csr**

You surely love to do certificate signing requests as much as everyone else. For single as well as multi domain (SAN) certificates, this script makes it a little less cumbersome.
